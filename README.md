Welcome to Streamly!

Streamly is a streaming service (kind of like Twitch) written in React featuring:
- Redux
- Redux-thunk middleware
- User authentication with Google Sign in
- Styling with Semantic UI

This was a class project where I learned about
- Components
- State Handling/
- Middleware

Users can sign in with Google to create, edit, delete, and serve live streams. If you want to test it locally you'll need to configure an RTMP server such as NodeMediaServer to host the stream. From there you can use software like OBS to stream to the platform.
